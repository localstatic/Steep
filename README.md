Steep
=====

Steep is a tea timer application written in Python & using PyGTK and Glade for the GUI. I wrote it so that I could use the same program on Linux and Windows. It runs on both platforms, assuming the prerequisites are installed. It likely will run on other platforms as well, but I have not tested this. 

Features
--------

 * User-configurable timers
 * User-configurable "finished" message
 * Optionally play a sound when finished

To Do
-----

The program works decently now, but there are some things that I will be adding to bring it to the point that it fulfills my needs better:

 * Sorting of timers list
 * UI for adding timers & editing timer properties

Requirements
------------

 * Python
 * python-gtk2
 * python-glade
