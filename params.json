{"name":"Steep","tagline":"Tea timer application in Python","body":"Steep\r\n=====\r\n\r\nSteep is a tea timer application written in Python & using PyGTK and Glade for the GUI. I wrote it so that I could use the same program on Linux and Windows. It runs on both platforms, assuming the prerequisites are installed. It likely will run on other platforms as well, but I have not tested this. \r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n * User-configurable timers\r\n * User-configurable \"finished\" message\r\n * Optionally play a sound when finished\r\n\r\nTo Do\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe program works decently now, but there are some things that I will be adding to bring it to the point that it fulfills my needs better:\r\n\r\n * Sorting of timers list\r\n * UI for adding timers & editing timer properties\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n * Python\r\n * python-gtk2\r\n * python-glade\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2008 Morgan Terry\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
