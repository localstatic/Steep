        <h1>Steep</h1>

<p>Steep is a tea timer application written in Python &amp; using PyGTK and Glade for the GUI. I wrote it so that I could use the same program on Linux and Windows. It runs on both platforms, assuming the prerequisites are installed. It likely will run on other platforms as well, but I have not tested this. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>User-configurable timers</li>
<li>User-configurable "finished" message</li>
<li>Optionally play a sound when finished</li>
</ul><h2>Screenshots</h2>

<h2>To Do</h2>

<p>The program works decently now, but there are some things that I will be adding to bring it to the point that it fulfills my needs better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sorting of timers list</li>
<li>UI for adding timers &amp; editing timer properties</li>
</ul><h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>python-gtk2</li>
<li>python-glade</li>
</ul><h2>License</h2>
